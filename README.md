- Which ship mode is most frequently chosen by customers?
- What are the top-selling products or categories?

### Geographical Insights

- Which countries, cities, or states contribute the most to the sales revenue?
- Are there any specific regions where sales are consistently lower? What factors might be contributing to this?

### Customer Segmentation

- Use the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) framework to segment customers.
